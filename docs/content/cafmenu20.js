<div class="lvl3">\
<p>\
The current page and all following pages can be moved to the left or to the right (with the headers and options) by placing the cursor \
outside of the area with the slots, for example by placing it on the top 4 lines of the screen, and then pressing F7 or F8, resp. When moved \
to the left the options and headers on the current page n are moved to page n-1 and all following pages are also moved one page to the left. \
The previous page (n-1) must be empty and will be filled with the options and headers of page n. When moved to the right the options and \
headers on the current page n are moved to page n+1 and all following pages are also moved to the right. The last page (999) must be empty. \
The current page n becomes empty.\
</p>\
<p>\
The options and headers on a vertical strip can be moved up or down by placing the cursor on a (filled) slot and pressing F7 or F8, resp. \
Pressing F7 causes all options and headers from the current cursor position and below to be moved one slot upwards. Pressing F8 causes all \
options and headers from the current cursor position and below to be moved one slot downwards.\
