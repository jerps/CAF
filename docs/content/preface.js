<p>\
The main purpose of this software is to serve as a concrete example of a way to organize RPG code, comprising several applications, \
into programs, modules and service programs. The code is relatively modern RPGIV and usable on IBM i V5R4. It implements \
some useful generic functionality and a couple of example applications, such as a simple menu system. The code is fairly well tested \
and has few bugs.\
</p>\
<p>\
There won\'t be any further development of this project. Maybe some bugfixes. The software is provided "as-is" without any support.\
The software can be used as the basis for a new application architecture, as a source for inspiration, to copy/paste code from, \
or for the menu system.\
