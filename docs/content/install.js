<h1 id="install">Installation</h1>\
<p>\
CAF can be installed either by <a href="#rstsavf">restoring the CAF library from a save file</a>, or by <a href="#buildsrc">building the library from source</a>. \
The first method is the easiest and quickest. A save file may contain objects that are compiled for an older release and you may want to compile all \
objects using the *CURRENT release. Maybe there is no save file that is compatible with the target IBM i. In these cases the CAF library needs to be <a href="#buildsrc">built from source</a>.\
