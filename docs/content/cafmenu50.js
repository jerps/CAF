<p>\
When updating the menu, displaying the menu for a specific user can be simulated by pressing F11. In the top left of \
the screen a user id can be entered. The headers and options will be displayed as if the menu is displayed for that \
specific user. Only the allowed options are shown. Headers without options are not displayed. Headers and options on \
one vertical strip move upwards to close any gaps. Empty pages (or pages with no allowable options) will be removed. \
Enter an asterisk (*) for the user id to display all options. Press F11 again to exit the simulation.\
