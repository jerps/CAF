## CAF v1.00.0

### IBM i Common Application Framework (RPGIV, 5250)

***

The main purpose of this software is to serve as a concrete example of a way to organize RPG code, comprising several applications, into programs, modules and service programs. The code is relatively modern RPGIV and usable on IBM i V5R4. It implements some useful generic functionality and a couple of example applications, such as a simple menu system. The code is fairly well tested and has few bugs.

There won't be any further development of this project. Maybe some bugfixes. The software is provided "as-is" without any support. The software can be used as the basis for a new application architecture, as a source for inspiration, to copy/paste code from, or for the menu system.
